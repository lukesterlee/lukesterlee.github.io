  <div id="faq">
    <h2 class="header">FAQ</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><span>Why do you want to take this course? What is your goal after graduating from Access Code?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Queens College curriculum is great but they donâ€™t teach real world application skills. My goal is getting a job that I feel passionate about and one that can achieve something important for people.</li>
        </ul>

</li>
      <li><span>Tell us about something that you are passionate about and how you went about pursuing this passion.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Along with technology, I always have been passionate about music but I never got any chance to learn it when I was young. After I went to college in Korea, I joined an amateur orchestra so I could learn violin for free. Since viola players were missing in our orchestra, I switched my instrument to viola. The desire to learn more about music grew on me over time, so I finally pursued my passion by minoring music in Queens College. One of my hopes is to use technology to build interest and expand access to classical music among young people.</li>
        </ul>

</li>
      <li><span>Describe a problem that you have encountered in the past and how you went about solving that problem.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>I joined an amateur orchestra when I was in college in Korea. However, when I was in sophomore year, we couldn't afford to rent out a concert venue. Therefore, I came up with an idea of some sort of local sponsorship. We visited every business (almost 300) including restaurants near our campus with our previous concert program, and asked them to donate money in exchange for putting ads in the program. Our college clubs had never tried something like that, and I was proud that we could put on the concert with community support.</li>
        </ul>
